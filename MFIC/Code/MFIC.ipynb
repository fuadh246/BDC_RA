      "Tag: Generally, the interest rate on floating interest rate investments is at benchmark rate plus spread. The borrower has an option to choose the benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the federal funds rate or the prime rate. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rates (1M L, 2M L, 3M L or 6M L, respectively), EURIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day EURIBOR rates (3M E), Bank Bill Swap rates are typically index to 90-day Bank Bill Swap rates (3M BBSW), GBP LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day GBP LIBOR rates (3M GBP L) and EUR LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day EUR LIBOR rates (3M E L) at the borrower’s option. LIBOR and EURIBOR loans may be subject to interest floors.

      "Tag: Generally, the interest rate on floating interest rate investments is at benchmark rate plus spread. The borrower has an option to choose the benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the federal funds rate or the prime rate (“Prime”). The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rates (1M L, 2M L, 3M L or 6M L, respectively), EURIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day EURIBOR rates (3M E), Bank Bill Swap rates are typically index to 90-day Bank Bill Swap rates  (3M BBSW), GBP LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day GBP LIBOR rates (3M GBP L) and EUR LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day EUR LIBOR rates (3M E L) at the borrower’s option. LIBOR and EURIBOR loans may be subject to interest floors. As of September 30, 2020, rates for 1M L, 2M L, 3M L, 6M L, 1M E, 3M E, 1M BBSW, 3M BBSW, 3M GBP L, 3M E L and Prime are 0.15%, 0.19%, 0.23%,0.26%, (0.53%), (0.50%), (0.04%), (0.04%), 0.06%, (0.52%) and 3.25%, respectively.\n",

      "Tag: Generally, the interest rate on floating interest rate investments is at benchmark rate plus spread. The borrower has an option to choose the benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the federal funds rate or the prime rate. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the Schedule of Investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect as of the reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 30-day, 60-day, 90-day or 180-day LIBOR rates (1M L, 2M L, 3M L or 6M L, respectively), and EURIBOR loans are typically indexed to 90-day EURIBOR rates (3M E), at the borrower’s option. LIBOR and EURIBOR loans may be subject to interest floors. As of March 31, 2019, rates for 1M L, 2M L, 3M L, 6M L, 1M E, 3M E, 1M BBSW, 3M BBSW, 3M GBP L and Prime are 2.49%, 2.56%, 2.60%, 2.66%, (0.42%), (0.35%), 1.80%, 1.77%, 0.84%, and 5.50%, respectively.\n",
