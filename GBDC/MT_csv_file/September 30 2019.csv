0,Description of the Matter,"At September 30, 2019, the fair value of the Company’s investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the fair value hierarchy (Level 3 investments) totaled $4,169,288 thousand. Management determines the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments by applying the methodologies outlined in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements and using significant unobservable inputs and assumptions. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments requires management to make judgments about the valuation methodologies (i.e., market approach or income approach) and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions including, among others, EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples, and market interest rates for similar loans with similar credit profiles, used in determining the fair value measurements.  Auditing the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments was complex, as the unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company are highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the fair value measurements of such investments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit,"We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s investment valuation process. This included controls over management's assessment of the valuation methodologies and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value measurements of the Level 3 investments.  Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company’s valuation methodologies, testing the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investments, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s valuation calculations. For each Level 3 investment, we reviewed the information considered by the Board of Directors relating to the Company’s determination of fair value. For a sample of the Company’s Level 3 investments, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we independently developed fair value estimates and compared them to the Company’s estimates. We developed our independent fair value estimates by using borrower financial information, which we compared to agreements or underlying source documents provided to the Company by the borrowers, and available market information from third-party sources, such as market spreads, market multiples, and leverage. We also evaluated subsequent events and other available information and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company’s year-end valuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
