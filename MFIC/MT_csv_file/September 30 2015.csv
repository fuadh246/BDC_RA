236,(20),"Generally, the interest rate on variable interest rate investments is at benchmark rate plus spread. The borrower has an option to choose the benchmark rate which can be LIBOR , ABR, prime or any other similarly defined rate. The spread may change based on the type of rate used. The terms in the schedule of investments disclose the actual interest rate in effect which is at LIBOR plus spread or ABR plus spread as of reporting period. LIBOR loans are typically indexed to 30-day, 90-day,180-day or 360-day LIBOR rates (1M L, 3M L, 6M L or 12M L, respectively), at the borrower’s option, and ABR rates are typically indexed to the current prime rate or federal funds rate. Both LIBOR and ABR rates are subject to interest floors. As of  September 30, 2015  , rates for 1M L, 3M L, 6M L or 12M L are 0.193%, 0.325%, 0.534% and 0.851%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
