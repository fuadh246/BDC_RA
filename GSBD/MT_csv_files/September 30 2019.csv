224,(+),,"The Consolidated Schedule of Investments discloses the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by reference to either LIBOR (“L”) or alternate base rate (commonly based on the Prime Rate (“P”)), at the borrower’s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L rates. As of September 30, 2019, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 2.03 , 2.06 , 2.09 , 2.07 , 2.02and 1.91 , respectively. As of September 30, 2019, P was 5.00 . For investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at September 30, 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
